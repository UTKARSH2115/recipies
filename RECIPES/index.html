    <h4>lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.
        Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
            seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
